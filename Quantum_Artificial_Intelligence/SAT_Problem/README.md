# Quantum Computation: Resetting vs. Uncomputing

In quantum computation we cannot simply "reset" qubits to their initial state like you can with classical bits. This limitation arises from two key quantum principles:

No-deleting theorem: Quantum information cannot be arbitrarily erased

Unitarity: All quantum operations must be reversible (except measurement)
