# QAI(Software designing based on binary quantum computing systems) 
With the appearance of first small quantum computers by IBM, Google, Microsoft and developing quantum artificial intelligence (QAI) emerged. The quantum computers execute some quantum circuits with a certain error, their capacity varies from 5 qubit to 127 qubit, but the race is set up. One of the most popular software development kits (SDK) for working with quantum computers is Qiskit [1].
